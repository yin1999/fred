# Fred

MDN's next fr(ont)e(n)d.

## Getting started

1. Copy `.env-dist` to `.env` and update
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. In one terminal window, start the backend: `node --env-file=.env --run rari -- serve`
4. In another terminal window, start the frontend:

- Run local dev server `npm run dev`
- Open `http://localhost:3000/en-US/` to see the homepage

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have another local server running on port 3000, fred will use the next available port (e.g. 3001).

## Development principles

### Layout

See [the layout README](./components/layout/README.md).

### Media queries

See [the media queries README](./components/media/README.md).

### Components and Elements

- Components should live in the `components/` folder, with reserved names which cause certain behavior, explained further below:
  - `component-name/`
    - `global.css` - (reserved): automatically added to global styles
    - `element.js` - (reserved): custom element, automatically imported client side, always imported server side
    - `element.css` - (recommended): styles for custom element's shadow dom
    - `server.js` - (reserved): server component, will automatically load the adjacent `server.css` file when used
    - `server.css` - (reserved): automatically added to page styles when its server component is used in that page
- `global.css`: components which have CSS which should be loaded on _all_ pages should expose that through a `global.css` file:
  - This should be used sparingly, use it for things needed in almost all components, like colors, fonts, etc.
  - Or, when creating a custom element, use it to set the "browser default" styles on that custom element: usually as simple as just `mdn-component-name { display: block; }` or similar
- `element.js`: custom elements should be defined in `components/component-name/element.js`
  - The class should be exported, and named `MDNComponentName`
    - Acronyms should be kept all caps, to match the naming of `HTMLElement` class names, and added to `ACRONYMS` in `build/plugins/generate-element-map.js` to allow the correct types to be generated
  - The element should be registered with a name of `mdn-component-name`
  - If all this is done:
    - The element will be automatically loaded client side if it's present in the DOM at page load
      - Elements inserted client side (i.e. in a hook, or another custom element) won't be automatically loaded, and the hook should handle loading them: probably with an async `import()`
    - The element will be automatically loaded server side for SSR
    - The element will automatically be added to `types/element-map.d.ts` to provide proper types in e.g. `querySelector("mdn-component-name")`
- `server.js`: server components should be defined in `components/component-name/server.js`
  - The class should extend `ServerComponent` from `components/server/index.js`, and be named `ComponentName`
- `server.css`: server component styles should be placed in `components/component-name/server.css`
  - These will be automatically loaded server side when the adjacent `ServerComponent` is used
    - Therefore, these styles should be scoped to the component, usually with a wrapping class

### Typing

- We use [TypeScript in JSDoc annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) for typing, so we can write and directly execute JavaScript (with no transpilation step)
- We occasionally use TypeScript files directly for writing types/interface which are too complex to easily write in JSDoc
- Eventually we'll have a fully typed codebase, with no errors: while we're in active development we can ignore errors in the interest of development speed/pragmatism:
  - If we do so, we should use `// @ts-expect-error` so we get an error when we fix the error and don't leave unnecessary `// @ts-ignore` comments lying around. While we're in active development these can lack a comment, but eventually we'll require an explanatory comment on each.
